I began the fall semester of my third year at Columbia University with high hopes. I was living in coveted housing, at the newly renovated 
brownstone building for Special Interest Communities, with my friends from the [Application Development Initiative](http://adicu.com). I was signed up for classes that I thought I wanted to take. I had just spent a summer doing a kickass fellowship program ([hackNY](http://hackny.org)), and was generally having the time of my life. 

Except, well, something felt off. 

As I started attending my classes, started working on problem sets, and started slipping back into Columbia life, I started to feel sad. And not just a "I'm sad that the summer is over" sad, but a deeper kind of sad where I would burst into tears for seemingly no reason. A kind of sad where I started to judge my self-worth, started questioning where I wanted to go with my life, where I stood as an aspiring web developer, where I stood as a *person*.

All of these things were stopping me from paying attention to my schoolwork. I felt myself becoming unmotivated, burnt-out, and directionless. I found my crying sessions increasing with greater frequency. I would sob behind the safety of my single dorm room. And at that point I knew that if I were to continue pretending to be a student, I would invariably fail my classes and disappoint my friends and family. So, I seriously started thinking about my options, eventually concluding on taking a leave of absence from Columbia. After struggling with the decision, talking to friends, *finally* convincing my mother, I decided to do it.  

So where am I now?

It's been about a week and a half since I've moved out. I don't have classes, and I'm currently looking for jobs. In fact, it's been quite jarring.
I've always had something to do: attend classes, run errands for clubs, go to work, etc. But now I am completely free from obligations that I had only a few weeks ago. It hasn't been easy, actually. A lot of the time, I feel lonely and confused. But a lot of the time, I also feel very grateful to have this opportunity.

I am engaging in some self-reflection, some self-directed learning, and working on projects that I haven't had time for before. I started reading ___Land of Lisp___ at the recommendation of my friend [Aditya](http://twitter.com/chimeracoder) and have been having a fun time with that. I failed an interview because I didn't brush up on my data structures and algorithms. (I have since started working through coding exercises from the book ___Cracking the Coding Interview___ as recommended to me by my friend [Jen](http://twitter.com/rubinovitz)). I worked on a freelance contracting job as a web developer for [Oliver's Apparel](http://oliversapparel.com), an extremely successful Kickstarter Campagin for men's atheltic apparel. I have a slew of interviews coming up for a 2014 summer internship, so that has been keeping me busy. I built a silly app for the hackNY fall 2013 hackathon called [Excuseti.me](http://excuseti.me) that unfortunately didn't work during the demo because Matt and I didn't do error handling for international users, which has since been fixed (try it out!). I have ambitions to become a better programmer in Python and to learn AngularJS.

Honestly, I'm not really sure what I'll be doing until I return to school in the fall of 2014. I hope I'll be a much different person then, someone more sure of herself, so we'll see. I will be posting updates as time progresses.

I just wanted to say thanks for all those who have been supportive of me since I have made my decision. <3

Over and out,</br>
