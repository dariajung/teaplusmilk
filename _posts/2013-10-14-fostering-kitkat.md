Kitkat with Matt. (And my hand at a weird angle).

Last Monday, Matt and I put in an application to foster a kitten, Shalon, through the [Anjellicle Cats Rescue](http://www.anjelliclecats.com/) 
in New York City. We found the kitten on the Animal Care and Control website, and were expecting to foster him. However, we were told
that only cats on the euthanasia list were currently being pulled from shelters.

The night before Fran, now affectionately known as Kitkat, was to be euthanized, we looked through pictures of 
20-something cats who were to be killed for reasons that deemed them 'unadoptable'. Kitkat's previous owner had been evicted from his/her home.

Kitkat, along with four other cats from his previous home, were left in the care of the city of New York, which unfortunately meant going to a kill shelter. Once these shelters run out of room, they have no other choice but to kill animals, a sad reality that animal groups like Anjellicle fight against.

I picked Kitkat up from the East Harlem shelter on Thursday. The first night, Kitkat was scared of us, tenatively eating his food and hiding underneath the bed. It's only been a few days, but I think he's warmed up to us! He's letting us hold him and pet him, purring when we do so.

We're currently fostering him, but we might end up adopting him. He's pretty cute.
